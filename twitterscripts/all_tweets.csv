‚Äúenjoyed‚Äù is the wrong word. ‚Äúhad strategy‚Äù. it sucks lmao
there was precisely one battle in the game i enjoyed on Hard (i‚Äôve since switched permanently to normal) and it let me restart from the top
even then you end up just getting total party wiped in one turn when they do some random bullshit and then you just lost an hour of progress
but the enemy can also do this and literally your only defense against it is niche Wall spells which only defend against one element
your goal is to chain together enemy weaknesses to give yourself extra turns and quickly dispatch the enemy
persona 5 really fuckin steps in it wrt rpg battle system design
