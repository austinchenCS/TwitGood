@jsonbecker Yeah! Sociologists just know how unjust society is in their bones. She's never surprised at how cruel and unfair humans are.
@jsonbecker I like that framing.
"@jsonbecker My sociologist wife reminded me that society does not value many lives very much at all - she guessed 12 yrs as average, dismal"
"@jsonbecker And trust in public institutions (education, police, etc.) has rapidly (and in many cases rightly) eroded dramatically"
@jsonbecker Here's my fact: Average jail sentence for murder 11.2 yrs. For drug possession? 3.6 ys. The moral equivalency is terrifying.
@jsonbecker The stakes are really high and juries expecting more these days too. How do you prove evidence was never tampered with?
"@jsonbecker I'm sure there are data entry and tracking systems, but there are multiple reporting requirements (local, state, federal)"
@jsonbecker Paperwork and bureaucracy. Officers have a million procedures and processes to follow. Arresting someone takes all day.
@jknowles Only then can I begin to think and question things properly. My ignorance on criminal justice is deeper than I ever imagined.
@jknowles Understanding that I do not understand this is key. Have to learn it to my bones. Have to seek out that perspective actively
@jknowles There are people who interact with police every single day of their lives. And people with very different expectations from them.
@jknowles But worse because everyone went to school. Many (like me) only interact with police through watching TV or occasional traffic stop
@jknowles Similar to education where people's own experience in school often strongly shapes their framing of problems and solutions
@jknowles Psychologists would not be surprised that your baseline of reality can be slowly shifted when the gap between it and TV is so high
"@jknowles It's incredible how even though I know it's fake, TV has shaped my perception of policing in America. Art and culture matter a lot"
@jknowles Starting with textbooks full of facts and figures and a couple of memoirs by police officers to get both the facts and feel right
"Working hard these days to unlearn everything I've ""learned"" about policing and criminal justice from watching Amercan TV for 20 years"

Somehow both Eleanor and FDR were the strongest advocates and most effective allies of workers and disenfranchised masses in their era.

Neighbors in their posh neighborhood complained about the constant crying of the baby and threatened to report the family.

"@jknowles My dissertation studied elections in school boards. Many gov. services are administered by locally elected officials, not Feds."
@jknowles Comparisons that do exist rarely adjust for basic demographic differences and are unfair. Most local gov. functions as an island.
@jknowles Comparing your community on both outputs and inputs to gov. services is too hard and this puts advocates at a disadvantage.
@jknowles Do you have adequate county mental health services compared to similar counties nationwide? What about water quality?

@philsites @Bharper3407 He's my only hope I think.
"@philsites Agreed, but they still play. Maybe fans won't show up in baseball though because there are so many other games"
ESPN will struggle with my generation because they think one random baseball game out of hundreds is more interesting than playoff hockey.
Baseball is so boring they have a required stretch break toward the end because no one jumps out of their seats at a great baseball play.
"If you commit a crime just remember to say: ""This is playoff basketball."" According to NBA commentator, this justifies nearly anything."
It's not over the back if Kwahi Leonard does it. Woulda got ejected in middle school if I pulled that.
"That ball went ten yards past the upright, what a kick."
Baseball is so boring that they get excited about how far you exceed what's necessary to score. Not just a home run but a 450 foot home run
@philsites Somehow football players have to wrestle with each other in mini spells of combat for sixty minutes in the rain though üòí
@donmoyn Agree. Probably the only sensible take on Trump out there. Won't get you a column in NYT though unfortunately.
Why can't baseball be played in the rain? You can run on wet dirt safely. Is it too hard to pitch a wet ball? I don't understand...

@agamoran @SchlFinance101 Administrative burden and capability to reliably report this is also an issue. Requires new thinking on accounting
"@SchlFinance101 @agamoran @alexanderrusso Also very complex to account for shared resources, shared staff, and shared infrastructure costs."

@NateSilver538 Not saying poli sci is not flawed. There are serious debates about causality in election research. Read up on it.
"@NateSilver538 Not sure endorsements is considered a fundamental in mainstream political science. Very debated concept, weak causality."

@meansandrew I heard it plenty. Great to be in a place it's a shared value
Huh. Government seems to be missing from the picture here. Gov produces data and coordinates non profit work often #DoGoodData2016
@AKrolikowski @DA4SG @meansandrew Getting out from behind the computer into the field and talking to users needs to be part of the job.
@nandevers10 @revodavid Exactly. Find others online or at your office you can share the pain with. But hang in there.

@roxLjohnson Wow. Thanks for taking the time to put this together. It looks so helpful. I will share far and wide.
@dwhitesock Very cool.
@dwhitesock Interesting. Most donations feel like sales to me. I'm buying impact when I give. Why not other products?
There are no bad questions when learning these things and you'll never stop. Continuous learning is one of the rewards #DoGoodData2016
"It'll be hard and take longer, but you'll focus on skills relevant to your work. Let your peers know and ask for help often #DoGoodData2016"
"A few have asked how to level up Python or #rstats skills. My advice, pick a project and commit to using those tools. #DoGoodData2016"
@dwhitesock I've always been confused by the distinction. Probably because I've only worked in gov. This makes sense to me
What? This is amazing. Thanks @thosjleeper  https://t.co/MkahQRLW1l

"@hunter_owens @cartoDB @Stuart_Lynn Looked just now. @cartoDB is going further: API, classification algorithm, and easy shapefile export"
Looks like @cartoDB is going to try to relieve a lot of our ACS headaches for us says @stuart_lynn #DoGoodData2016
One takeaway from me is how important it is for gov to create data sources and analyses to empower non-profits. Key partner #DoGoodData2016

I think a lot of states will be very curious to learn how and under what conditions they acquired the data https://t.co/ClUtVi3lHV
"Good thread here, @BillDeBaun gives food for thought #DoGoodData2016 https://t.co/mEldtRDJqK"
@lnhaynes Totally agreed. Happens almost weekly in government
Get some folks together to do this panel with @LizaMu so we can stir up more ideas for culture building https://t.co/6LWzNkucfb
"@BillDeBaun Including me, but I'm not sure what the real keys are. Definitely thinking hard about it now"
"Outsiders can definitely be a key strategy to reinforce internal champions. If you pay for it, it creates legitimacy https://t.co/l6bDGYSoVk"
@LizaMu Yes. I am not sure of how much from my org will be helpful to others. Eager to hear what other orgs are doing to hear alternatives
Any education or government people at #DoGoodData2016 want to meet up during lunch today? Message me. Might be fun to talk in a small group
"Small bets to prove value of data analytics is a great idea. But, how do you get people in place to identify data successes #DoGoodData2016"

"@BillDeBaun Thanks, really enjoyed your questions. Hope we can talk more!"
. @sswerdlow telling us how to use PUMA data to better estimate public benefit uptake rates. Cool! #DoGoodData2016
Government agencies are the original data scientists says @CivisAnalytics. Nice @toddharris #DoGoodData2016
"""Data is never the whole solution, need to learn continuously in a cycle."" - @toddharris; great point! Building ongoing learning is hard."
"Loved presenting at #DoGoodData2016, but doing so meant one less great workshop to attend. Great panels"
Really love this framing @SteveHeye https://t.co/EJ4P2VqB0W

I'm putting final touches on the presentation #DoGoodData2016 I can't wait to talk to you. (Wright at 1:15) https://t.co/9ObbPkO3fj
@LauraS2112 It's a conference for people doing what you do it sounds like. Lots of people here talking about how isolated the work can be
"Key problem is that owning my data in isolation is not valuable, what should I compare with? Whole is greater than parts. #DoGoodData2016"
"A teaser for my talk at 1pm today; there will be gifs, Voltron, and a look at early data fails in building a prediction tool #DoGoodData2016"
"@SteveHeye Agree.? Seems most important, because non data staff can grab onto it and help too if it's shared"
@BillDeBaun ggplot2 in R with facet wrap and the minimal theme. Can post process in Inkscape for final touches
Social sector is so complex. Need diverse methods paired with strong communication of results. At #DoGoodData2016 many working on just this
"Agreed! Great analysis is neither necessary nor sufficient to spur action, but it can be a force multiplier https://t.co/c8RfVoWcWY"
"@BillDeBaun Thanks. I hope we connect! Talk will focus on process, not technical details, but that's because I found this part harder"
"Excited to talk about using machine learning to solve real problems in government at #DoGoodData2016 after lunch. Process, process, process"
"Good morning #DoGoodData2016, you are looking good! https://t.co/4psLNQCJCe"

Oh this is a fun game. I have dibs on @TheRock  https://t.co/svuwe2perZ
Complex social problems require multidimensional and hierarchical analyses to understand. The communication norms are holding back discourse
"Models enable multidimensional thinking and analysis, but are rarely presented in intuitive or accessible ways. Tables are lousy."
"If I had significant time to focus on any problem, I'd choose creating new standardized visual representations of statistical models."
I love this https://t.co/6BaHLPSBVD
"What? I can submit to APSR without data or code, who knew it was so easy! https://t.co/pW02fOORT5"
"@billbarnwell Dang that sounds good on paper, did it match it's expected taste-share?"
A fundamental thing I always confuse is conflating people's consumption with their income.
"A simple deterministic model is a starting place, not an end goal."
"If we want to do this well, me included, we need to talk to people and fill in the gaps and nuance. Social system is too complex."
Stories created by researchers are very likely to be overly simple and biased in unpredictable ways we would not accept from a stat model
Always bothers me in quantitative social science when results sections turn to stories for interpretation. Here the quant qual divide is bad
"To many teachers are the 1%, because they'll never meet someone who earns much more. Income segregation has deep political consequences"
The problem many don't realize is in many communities teachers earn the highest wage. This can foster resentments https://t.co/NDPfBxcj7Z
"Do not miss this Madison. @KathyJCramer is amazing and one of the few to study perceptions of higher ed rigorously
https://t.co/XA1ndHbyGU"
"Policymakers vary. Strength of prior beliefs varies. And, ability to implement change varies. Political use of evidence is hard."
@tjmahr Congrats!!!!
"Thank you @IRP_UW for a thought provoking conference on Intergenerational Poverty. Lots to think on for policy, theory, and methods."
.@sndurlauf Appreciate the corrective to learning and adaption from implementation and replication. Complex problems require orgs learning.
@JennyBryan Talking to @BatesDmbates and having my mind blown
Important to keep in mind when being realistic about evidence based policymaking potential impact. https://t.co/b424uYmNpv
.@sndurlauf really enjoyed the talk and the concept of robust policy at the end
@Gimperion Ah classic RAM CPU tradeoff paradox
It's a great example of how nuanced interpretation may need to be. And nuance is costly in policy discussion. What do we do then?
"People who want policymakers to use evidence, please think of how you'd advise us on results like the MTO experiment?"
Evidence use by policymakers is hard. How many interpretations are there of the MTO experiment. What does it suggest aside from more study?
Thanks @IRP_UW for organizing a conference on Intergenerational Transmission of Poverty. Important work to share publicly.
"@GovLoop @MarkLogic I'm not sure it's fair to characterize it as waste. Better formats are key, but EDA and cleaning are vital to modeling"
Yes. Read this great piece. https://t.co/x2Q2Jky3BC
Want more evidence use in policymaking? Let's give researchers a poli sci 101 to help them understand these audiences. #EvidenceCrossraods
@philsites @TheAVClub Always associate it with great times with you

"I wonder if Ted Cruz invokes the Constitution when his children ask him why they have to eat vegetables. His version of ""because I said so""."
"We don't get the boarding process that makes sense, we get the boarding process we deserve #humanity"
My $.02 is if we want evidence use we need to help agencies invest in building complimentary internal analytic capacity. #EvidenceCrossroads
"PSA, do not turn your pc off while running an #rstats script that uses compiled code on Windows. Just spent two hours fixing pkg installs."

@jsonbecker Interesting! That's a real concern and I'm not sure how to address it well.
@jsonbecker You have firsthand experience about entrenched IT interests though. Benefits need to be very big right?
"@jsonbecker Yes, a future to believe in!"
@FishmanSeth Very little incentive indeed! But it seems critical and often happens implicitly by using disciplinary labels.

"The measures, methods, and assumptions in regression analysis are as critical as in ethnographies it seems. No model is unbiased #AERA16"
Wonder if quant researchers should acknowledge their positionality in their work the way qual research does #AERA16
Always relearn at #AERA that I should read more qualitative work to think about mechanisms and complexity in school organizations #AERA16
Also likely much opportunity as well
Theme in many different papers is how complex and multi faceted schools are. Schools within schools pose challenges to study #AERA16
Seems like partnering with schools as a researcher has a number of names and forms. What are key differences among them? #AERA16
@rmc031 @jessicashiller @arielabd Check out the work of @devencarlson at OU. Has done some great work on this in Ohio
"Participants who resist data collect. may do so because they know it is not working, this is a challenge and an opportunity @bpenuel #AERA16"
Reframing it from implementation to learning highlights that it is a mutual activity says @bpenuel -- Great point! #AERA16
Just bringing evidence is not enough - need to plan for scale from the beginning and use system analysis to execute iteratively #AERA16
@jknowles Key question this raises for me is do institutions have the resources/skills necessary to do this work well?
Implementation is really complex in large organizations. Requires multiple small studies of many processes to create success #AERA16

That's a real and lasting challenge the party and country face regardless of outcome.
To me on Dem side it's a difference of risk tolerance. Bernie support has shown that many feel they have little to lose in status quo.
"Bernie is high risk, high reward. For me and many others I think we feel like the risk is more to others than us, so why not shoot high?"
"Both are valid approaches; that's the divide Dems face. I'm just skeptical it will get better for those I care about if we ""fix"" status quo."
"But good sir, no machine can carry a person in the sky. Please stop fooling around and help us build a better boiler for our steam engines."
"Maybe Bernie's policies are unrealistic in today's climate. That's the difference. I want the system to change, not a technician to fix it."

@carlbfrederick Colquitt was a clear MVP until the second Newton fumble. Pre-game prediction was based on the Vegas line -- not bold :-)
I suppose I should have replied to my own tweets to keep that tweetstorm together. Or Twitter could try to be user friendly.
@carlbfrederick Congrats on the win yesterday. What an all time great defense.
which is subject to the norms and traditions of various disciplines. In applied cases I think there is a richer set of criteria to consider.
There seems to be little academic research around this because most academic uses of such models are in the service of publication [7/n]
From the questions I get about merTools I think there is not enough discussion about how applied analysts should approach this [6/n]
Then I use that assessment to build a subjective cutoff for the interval and document the rationale [5/n]
I think about which I can eliminate with an argument. Then I think about how the prediction will be used and the cost of being wrong [4/n]
My goal is always to get a distribution for each prediction that reflects all of the sources of variance and then work backward [3/n]
"PIs should take into account all sources of uncertainty possible -- fixed, random, and overall model. [2/n]"
Had an interesting question about prediction intervals from multilevel models. [1/n]
