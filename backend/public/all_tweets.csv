"@spawningtool yes, that one is better. the insight to be learned from this is that mutas = cash money $_$"
@spawningtool im sure that ramble was a bit confusing but point is that the 30+ probably suffers from players throwing away mutas too much
@spawningtool hm. not bad. maybe 'muta count 1 minute before game end' separated by won and lost games and game length would be cool... XD

"@coL_qxc like if u have more sleep/food/phys stamina you get less recoil n get back down into it effortlessly, then its mb not as bad? idk"

@M_Dayshi imba man
"@M_Dayshi you certainly have nothing to complain about when it comes to playing when lacking sleep, you're exactly the same as normal"
@M_Dayshi weak my ass. you could stay up for 48 hours and still play well :D
@KansasFF @RotterdaM08 yeah that is only there because of the uber Rotti Special ^_^ GJ Kevin !!
"@XMGToD yup i asked around too, its like that for everyone. seems to be on the way back up"
@NamuStarcraft @HappyZerg1 xD ... there certainly is weakness to playing safe all the time too. only solution is to mix it up and dont care!
"@NamuStarcraft @HappyZerg1 try overly safe builds so that you never lose to all-ins, then practice macro so that you can (maybe) still win:)"
@HappyZerg1 sounds like it's time for CUSTOM GAMES ;D
